<h3>Job experience</h3>

    <p>Jan 2020 till date: graduate trainee at tangazoletu company limited</p>

<h3>Why programming?</h3>
     <p>Upon entrance into the workspace, I realised what I learnt in university was purely theoretical and didn't quite apply in the workspace. So I ventured into IT project management. This in an Agile environment meant planning sprints and running all scrum processes. It became hard to assign deliverables to developers as I didn't really know how much time should be allocated to each deliverable. So i decided to learn software development to help me understand all processes so that when allocating tasks its easier to know how much time is needed for each task.</p>
     <p>To be able to create websites for passion projects e.g Youth Ability Kenya – an organisation that aims to identify, nurture and grow talent/skills among the youth.</p>
